# Fixed Build - Ready to Use! üéâ

The Pantheon has been successfully fixed and rebuilt.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Memory Allocation Crash** - Added V8 memory limits to prevent OOM errors
2. **File Loading Issue** - Fixed the path to load index.html correctly in production
3. **Module Loading** - Made electron-store optional with fallback storage
4. **WebRTC Module** - Made @roamhq/wrtc optional to avoid native module issues

## Build Output

- **DMG**: `dist/Pantheon-1.0.0-arm64.dmg`
- **ZIP**: `dist/Pantheon-1.0.0-arm64-mac.zip`
- **App**: `dist/mac-arm64/Pantheon.app`

## How to Run

### Option 1: From DMG (Recommended)
1. Open `dist/Pantheon-1.0.0-arm64.dmg`
2. Drag the app to Applications
3. Right-click the app and select "Open" (first time only)

### Option 2: Direct from Build
```bash
open "dist/mac-arm64/Pantheon.app"
```

### Option 3: With Console Output
```bash
./test-app.sh
```

## Expected Behavior

When the app opens:
1. You'll see a login screen (Firebase authentication)
2. The app uses fallback storage (not electron-store in production)
3. Connects to signaling server at `https://6307090080.com`
4. WebRTC will use browser implementation (not native)

## Console Messages

You may see these messages (they're normal):
- "‚ö†Ô∏è electron-store not available, using fallback storage"
- "Native WebRTC module not available, using browser WebRTC"

## Troubleshooting

If the app doesn't open:
1. Check Console.app for crash logs
2. Try running with: `./test-app.sh` to see console output
3. Make sure to right-click ‚Üí Open on first launch

## Configuration

The app uses environment variables from:
- Development: `.env` file
- Production: `config.js` (created from `config.example.js`)

Make sure your Firebase configuration is set up correctly.
